#Note: all dimensions in this file are defined in millimeters, all positions are defined as values between 0 and 1

#keyword 'design' indicates the beginning of a project designs specifications, followed by the design name\

design example

#the size of the chassis is the dimensions of the prosthetic arm given, x and y values are separated by commas
chassis-size = 100,100

#the position of Landmark One, the location of the motor on your chassis in terms of x and y
#Note: since this must be along the side of the chassis only one value may be above zero
landmark1_location = 90,0
#the direction of rotation of Landmark One, either 'CW' or 'CCW' will default to 'CW' in invalid input
landmark1_direction = CW
#the rotation speed of Landmark One in rotations per second
landmark1_rotation = 0.125

#the position of Landmark Two, the location of the index finger joint on your chassis in terms of x and y
#Note: since this must be along the side of the chassis only one value may be above zero
landmark2_location = 0,90
#the direction of rotation of Landmark Two, either 'CW' or 'CCW' will default to 'CCW' in invalid input
landmark2_direction = CCW
#the rotation speed of Landmark Two in rotations per second
landmark2_rotation = 0.20

#the position of Landmark Three, the location of the thumb joint on your chassis in terms of x and y
#Note: since this must be along the side of the chassis only one value may be above zero
landmark3_location = 90,0
#the direction of rotation of Landmark Three, either 'CW' or 'CCW' will default to 'CCW' in invalid input
landmark3_direction = CW
#the rotation speed of Landmark Three in rotations per second
landmark3_rotation = 0.18
#the downward offset of Landmark Three, use this if the thumb joint does not lie in the same xy-plane as the thumb and motor
landmark3_offset = 15

#the diameter of the functional workspace the fingers must meet
functional_diameter = 35
#the downward offset from Landmark Two the center of the functional workspace is located
functional_offset2 = 65
#the forward offset from Landmark Three the center of the functional workspace is located
#Note: set as -1 if the functional workspace is located directly below Landmark Two
functional_offset3 = -1

#the keyword indicating the end of a designs specifications
#Note: only necessary is more than one design share the same project file
